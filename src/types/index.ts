 * # Types Folder Guidelines

In our project, the `types` folder is dedicated to TypeScript type definitions. These types play a crucial role in enhancing code readability, maintainability, and providing a clear contract for various parts of our application. Follow these guidelines when working with the `types` folder:

1. **Organize Types Purposefully:**
   - Keep the types organized based on their purpose. For example, consider creating separate files for commonly used types, API response types, and any other specific categories relevant to your project.

2. **Use Descriptive Filenames:**
   - Choose descriptive filenames for your type definition files. The filename should reflect the types' content or the entities they represent. This makes it easier for developers to locate the appropriate types.

3. **Group Related Types:**
   - If a set of types is closely related or used together, consider grouping them within a single file. This promotes modularity and helps developers understand the context of those types.

4. **Include Comments for Clarity:**
   - Add comments to your type definitions to provide additional context or explanations. Comments can be particularly helpful when the purpose of a type may not be immediately apparent.

5. **Use Meaningful Type Names:**
   - Choose meaningful and self-explanatory names for your types. This improves code readability and helps developers understand the intended use of each type without having to inspect the type definition itself.

6. **Export Types from Index File:**
   - Consider exporting types from an `index.d.ts` file within the `types` folder. This file can serve as an entry point for importing types throughout your application, making it convenient for developers to access and use them.

7. **Update Types Accordingly:**
   - Keep your type definitions up-to-date. If changes are made to the corresponding code, ensure that the types are modified accordingly to maintain consistency and avoid potential errors.

8. **Collaborate and Discuss:**
   - If you are introducing new types or making significant changes, communicate these modifications with the team. Collaboration and discussion around types can lead to better overall understanding and usage across the project.
